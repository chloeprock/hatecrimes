                    About the Project
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The data in this project was accessed through <a target="blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/louissebye/united-states-hate-crimes-19912017">kaggle.com</a> and originates from the FBI Crime Data Explorer. 
                    The data visualized in the line chart has been aggregated from the data downloaded in order to provide a summary of the total victims of hate crimes in each region for the years 1995-2015. 
                    Because the dataset available for download is very large, utilizing a summary of the data allows for the creation of a more readable visualization. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this visualization, the x-axis encodes years, while the y-axis encodes the total number of victims. 
                    You can view the data in 4 slices based on the regions included in the data (South, West, Northeast, and Midwest). 
                    The goal of the visualization is to enable comparisons: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                within each data slice, between number of victims per year for each of the 4 US regions
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                between the data slices, of the number of victims in different regions in the US.
                            </li>
                        </ol>  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each circle in the visualization represents one year of data. When hovering over a circle, a tooltip appears to provide information 
                    on the total number of victims of a hate crime that year. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some observations made from this visualization are: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The year 2001 represents a peak in victims of a hate crime across all 4 regions in the USA. 
                                In the Northeast only, there is a peak of almost the same size that occurs a few years earlier, in 1996. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The number of victims in the West is much higher than the other 3 regions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There was a decrease in the number of hate crimes from 2008 to 2009 across all 4 regions. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the South, West, and Northeast, the year 2014 had the lowest number of victims of a hate crime 
                                (relative to each region).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the Midwest, the lowest number of victims was during the year 2015. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Next Steps
                </h4>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that this data has not been normalized to account for region populations. In the future, it would be interesting to
                    combine the current dataset with census information in order to get a clearer picture of what regions in the US have not just the 
                    highest number of total victims of a hate crime, but have the most hate crimes proportional to their population.
